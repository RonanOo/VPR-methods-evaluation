# VPR-methods-evaluation

This repo is used to easily evaluate pre-trained Visual Place Recognition methods.
A number of trained models are supported (e.g. NetVLAD, SFRS, CosPlace, MixVPR...) and it uses the weights released by the respective authors.

## How to use

The code is designed to be readily used with our [VPR-datasets-downloader](https://github.com/gmberton/VPR-datasets-downloader) repo, so that using a few simple commands you can download a dataset and test any model on it. The VPR-datasets-downloader code allows you to download multiple VPR datasets that are automatically formatted in the same format as used by this repo.

```
mkdir VPR-codebase
cd vpr-codebase

git clone https://github.com/gmberton/VPR-datasets-downloader
cd VPR-datasets-downloader
python3 download_st_lucia.py

cd ..

git clone https://github.com/gmberton/VPR-methods-evaluation
cd VPR-methods-evaluation
python3 main.py --method=cosplace --backbone=ResNet18 --descriptors_dimension=512 \
    --database_folder=../VPR-datasets-downloader/datasets/st_lucia/images/test/database \
    --queries_folder=../VPR-datasets-downloader/datasets/st_lucia/images/test/queries
```

This should produce this as output `R@1: 98.8, R@5: 99.7, R@10: 99.9, R@20: 100.0`, which will be saved in a log file under `./logs/`

Specifically for the GCL model you can run

```
python3 main.py --method=gcl --backbone=ResNet152 --descriptors_dimension=2048 --database_folder=../VPR-datasets-downloader/datasets/st_lucia/images/test/database --queries_folder=../VPR-datasets-downloader/datasets/st_lucia/images/test/queries
```

You can easily change the paths for different datasets, and you can use any of the following methods: NetVLAD, SFRS, CosPlace, Conv-AP, MixVPR.
Note that each method has weights only for certain architectures. For example NetVLAD only has weights for VGG16 with descriptors_dimension 32768 and 4069 (with PCA).

### Visualize predictions

Predictions can be easily visualized through the `num_preds_to_save` parameter. For example running this

```
python3 main.py --method=cosplace --backbone=ResNet18 --descriptors_dimension=512 \
    --num_preds_to_save=3 --exp_name=cosplace_on_stlucia \
    --database_folder=../VPR-datasets-downloader/datasets/st_lucia/images/test/database \
    --queries_folder=../VPR-datasets-downloader/datasets/st_lucia/images/test/queries
```

will generate under the path `./logs/cosplace_on_stlucia/*/preds` images such as

<p float="left">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gmberton/VPR-methods-evaluation/master/images/pred.jpg"/>
</p>

Given that saving predictions for each query might take long, you can also pass the parameter `--save_only_wrong_preds` which will save only predictions for wrongly predicted queries (i.e. where the first prediction is wrong).

Kudos to the authors of [NetVLAD](https://github.com/Relja/netvlad), [SFRS](https://github.com/yxgeee/OpenIBL), [CosPlace](https://github.com/Relja/netvlad), [Conv-AP](https://github.com/amaralibey/gsv-cities) and [MixVPR](https://github.com/amaralibey/mixVPR) for open sourcing their models' weights. The code for each model has been taken from their respective repositories, excpet for the code for NetVLAD which has been taken from [hloc](https://github.com/cvg/Hierarchical-Localization).
